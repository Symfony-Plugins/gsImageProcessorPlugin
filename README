This plugin allows you to process incoming images. Resize, crop and add drop
shadows. It also includes a helper class that when passed the image input and 
output, plus an array of parameters, will automatically perform all effects and 
return a saved image object.

 Description

 This class allows for easy creation of images with a drop shadow effect.
 Images can be read from a file or passed as a string (as you might take
 the images from a database), and they can also be resized for easy
 creation of thumbnails.  You can also change the background colour of
 the image and generate the correct colour through the shadow.

 Requirements

 PHP 4.1.0+, GD 2.0.1+

 Shadow images

 I found that the best way to create a drop shadow was to first create
 the shadow in an art program, and then split it up into 8 seperate
 pieces; top left corner, top line, top right corner, left side, right
 side, bottom left corner, bottom line, and bottom right corner.

 If you don't like the spacing of the drop shadow, then you could easily
 create your own drop shadows and over-write the files supplied.  The
 different sizes of the drop-shadow images should be automatically taken
 into consideration.  If you create your own shadows then you must save
 them as PNG-24 (24-bit), as that level of alpha channels is required.

 If no drop-shadow images can be located (or it cannot load up all of the
 images) then it will still save the image (resized if you told it to be),
 just without the drop-shadow effect.
